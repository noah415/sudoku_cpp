# sudoku_cpp
My program to create a sudoku puzzle using c++.
When executing main file in terminal, you will see a 
full sudoku puzzle printed out. My program will generate 
totally random puzzles (as many and as fast as you want).

# What I Implemented in this build
- creating classes (Puzzle and Stack)
- using stack datastructure
- backtracking
- understanding of pointers and double pointers in 1d and 2d arrays
